			<p class="text-secondary">
				During Fall 2025, I completed my work term with the City of Guelph in an IT Service Desk Support role. The City supports a wide range of internal departments and relies on stable IT systems to
				keep day-to-day operations running smoothly. The service desk serves as a front line for issue intake,
				troubleshooting, and escalation when necessary.
			</p>

			<p class="text-secondary mb-0">
				This environment relates directly to computing through real-world incident management, troubleshooting,
				identity and access workflows, and documentation practices. It also provided experience working with
				enterprise tools and processes, where clarity, repeatability, and good communication directly affect user
				experience and operational efficiency.

		<section id="goals" class="section mb-5">
		<h2 class="h3 fw-bold">Goals / Learning Outcomes</h2>
		<p class="text-secondary">
			The following learning goals guided my work term and were evaluated through day-to-day performance,
			feedback, and my ability to work independently while maintaining high-quality support.
		</p>

		<div class="row g-4">
			<!-- Goal 1 -->
			<div class="col-lg-6">
			<div class="card h-100 shadow-sm">
				<div class="card-body">
				<h3 class="h5 fw-semibold">Goal 1 — Communication (Oral Communication)</h3>
					<p class="text-secondary mb-2">
						Strengthen my ability to communicate clearly and professionally with both technical and non-technical staff,
						ensuring information is conveyed accurately in conversations, meetings, and interactions.
					</p>

				<h4 class="h6 fw-semibold mb-1">Action Plan</h4>
				<ul class="text-secondary">
					<li>Use clear and professional language when interacting with users and team members</li>
					<li>Follow up consistently and ask clarifying questions when needed</li>
				</ul>

				<h4 class="h6 fw-semibold mb-1">Measure of Success</h4>
				<p class="text-secondary">
					Receive positive feedback from supervisors/users/colleagues and demonstrate the ability to explain technical
					concepts in a way non-technical staff can understand.
				</p>

				<h4 class="h6 fw-semibold mb-1">Reflection</h4>
				<p class="text-secondary mb-0">
					I made a conscious effort to use understandable language and keep explanations concise, especially when speaking
					with users who did not have technical backgrounds. When issues were highly technical, I focused on giving a clear
					high-level overview. A key area for improvement is organizing my thoughts more effectively so my explanations are
					less fragmented and sound more professional and articulate.
				</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			</div>

			<!-- Goal 2 -->
			<div class="col-lg-6">
			<div class="card h-100 shadow-sm">
				<div class="card-body">
				<h3 class="h5 fw-semibold">Goal 2 — Critical & Creative Thinking (Problem Solving)</h3>
				<p class="text-secondary mb-2">
					Develop stronger analytical and troubleshooting skills by applying structured approaches to resolving technical
					issues, identifying root causes, and implementing effective solutions.
				</p>

				<h4 class="h6 fw-semibold mb-1">Action Plan</h4>
				<ul class="text-secondary">
					<li>Take ownership of troubleshooting tickets and apply diagnostic steps</li>
					<li>Collaborate with colleagues when challenges arise and document solutions for reuse</li>
				</ul>

				<h4 class="h6 fw-semibold mb-1">Measure of Success</h4>
				<p class="text-secondary">
					Independently resolve approximately 2-3 incidents/service requests per day and successfully escalate or document
					complex issues with clear resolution details.
				</p>

				<h4 class="h6 fw-semibold mb-1">Reflection</h4>
				<p class="text-secondary mb-0">
					Over the term, I became significantly more independent in diagnosing issues and gained a stronger understanding of
					the technologies used at the City of Guelph. I improved my ability to handle calls and in-person support confidently.
					While I sometimes made incorrect initial decisions or misinterpreted issues, I worked to correct them quickly once
					identified. I can improve by reducing resolution time and reaching out for help earlier when appropriate. I consistently
					documented resolution details for less-common problems to support future troubleshooting.
				</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			</div>

			<!-- Goal 3 -->
			<div class="col-lg-12">
			<div class="card h-100 shadow-sm">
				<div class="card-body">
				<h3 class="h5 fw-semibold">Goal 3 — Technological Literacy</h3>
				<p class="text-secondary mb-2">
					Expand my knowledge and proficiency with the City of Guelph's IT systems, tools, and platforms, and apply this
					understanding to perform tasks efficiently and independently.
				</p>

				<div class="row g-3">
					<div class="col-lg-4">
					<h4 class="h6 fw-semibold mb-1">Action Plan</h4>
					<ul class="text-secondary mb-0">
						<li>Build proficiency with tools such as Cherwell, SharePoint, Active Directory, VPN, and related systems</li>
						<li>Learn by shadowing colleagues and practicing standard tasks</li>
					</ul>
					</div>
					<div class="col-lg-4">
					<h4 class="h6 fw-semibold mb-1">Measure of Success</h4>
					<ul class="text-secondary mb-0">
						<li>Use core applications independently</li>
						<li>Complete tasks like login resets, permissions changes, and troubleshooting with minimal supervision</li>
					</ul>
					</div>
					<div class="col-lg-4">
					<h4 class="h6 fw-semibold mb-1">Reflection</h4>
					<p class="text-secondary mb-0">
						I gained substantial experience with corporate IT systems and developed a stronger understanding of what happens
						behind the scenes in tools that are often abstracted for end users. This came from solving issues across multiple
						teams (e.g., network, server, asset control). While there are still tools/features I am not fully familiar with, I
						made an effort to learn the correct steps as incidents arose. I can complete most tasks I have permissions for
						without supervision, but I sometimes needed more clarity when expectations required inference. When I made
						mistakes, I focused on learning from them and avoiding repeats.

		<!-- Conclusion -->
		<section id="conclusion" class="section mb-5">
		<h2 class="h3 fw-bold">Conclusion</h2>
		<p class="text-secondary">
			This work term strengthened three core areas that will carry into future co-op roles: clear technical communication,
			structured troubleshooting, and practical proficiency with enterprise IT tools and workflows. I learned how important
			documentation and consistency are in a real support environment, and I gained confidence handling issues independently.
			Moving forward, my main improvement targets are reducing resolution time and communicating complex ideas more smoothly
			by organizing my thoughts more effectively.

		<p class="text-secondary mb-0">
			I would like to thank my supervisor and the IT Service Desk team at the City of Guelph for their support, guidance,

			operations work behind the scenes.
